# Security_aspects_of_ML

The course exposes to the security aspects and implications of machine learning. The course explains the main techniques currently used to attack machine learning (such as adversarial attacks, cloning, side channels attacks) and the most common techniques used to protect machine learning implementations (such as watermarking and fingerprinting, side channel countermeasures, and protections against adversarial attacks)
